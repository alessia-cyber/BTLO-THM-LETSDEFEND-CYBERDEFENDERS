# Blue Team Lab Online - Phishing Analysis


## Scenario

Someone received a phishing email and forwarded it to SOC. 


## Tools

- Text Editor (I used Visual Studio Code)
- WHOis
- URL2PNG 

## Steps

1. Opened the raw email in VS Code.  
2. Reviewed sender, receiver, subject, and date fields.  
3. Searched the body for hidden URLs and IP addresses.  
4. Checked the suspicious domain using WHOIS - no browsing of the site was performed.
5. Viewed a safe, non-interactive preview of the URL - using URL2PNG - without visiting the live page.
